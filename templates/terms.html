    <h1>Terms of Use</h1>

    <p>
      These Terms of Use (“Terms”) govern your use of the JobDash website and services
      (“JobDash”, “we”, “us”, “our”). By using JobDash, you agree to these Terms.
      If you do not agree, please do not use the site.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Platform only – no employment</h2>
    <p>
      JobDash is a platform that allows people to post short jobs and workers to find them.
      We are <strong>not</strong> an employer, staffing agency, or hiring company.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>No employment contract is created between JobDash and any worker.</li>
      <li>Workers are independent and are not employees, agents or partners of JobDash.</li>
      <li>Any work relationship is only between the person posting the job and the worker.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Payments are between users</h2>
    <p>
      Unless clearly stated otherwise on the platform, JobDash does not handle or process payments.
      The person posting the job is responsible for paying the worker directly (cash, app, or any
      method they agree on).
    </p>
    <p>
      JobDash is not responsible for:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Whether payment is made or not.</li>
      <li>The amount, timing, or method of payment.</li>
      <li>Any disputes about pay between users.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Your responsibilities</h2>
    <p>By using JobDash, you agree to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide accurate, honest information when posting or applying for jobs.</li>
      <li>Respect local laws, including immigration, tax and labor regulations.</li>
      <li>Use the platform in a respectful way and not harass or abuse other users.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      You are solely responsible for your own decisions when you meet, hire or work for someone
      through JobDash.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Safety and screening</h2>
    <p>
      JobDash does not guarantee the identity, background, skills or behavior of any user.
      We do not perform formal background checks on every user.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are responsible for your own safety. We strongly recommend that you:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Meet in safe, public or trusted locations where possible.</li>
      <li>Trust your instincts and refuse any job or meeting that feels unsafe.</li>
      <li>Call emergency services if you feel in danger.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. No guarantee of jobs or results</h2>
    <p>
      JobDash does not promise that you will find a job, a worker, or any specific result.
      The number of jobs and workers available can change at any time.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Prohibited use</h2>
    <p>You agree not to use JobDash to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Post illegal, dangerous, discriminatory or abusive jobs.</li>
      <li>Ask workers to do activities that violate the law or put them at risk.</li>
      <li>Send spam, scams, or fraudulent offers.</li>
      <li>Copy or scrape data from the platform without permission.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Limitation of liability</h2>
    <p>
      As far as allowed by law, JobDash, its owner and its team are <strong>not liable</strong>
      for any direct or indirect damages, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Injuries, accidents or incidents that happen during a job.</li>
      <li>Loss of money, loss of time, or missed opportunities.</li>
      <li>Disputes between users, including pay, quality of work or schedule.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Your use of JobDash is at your own risk. The platform is provided “as is” and “as available”.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Changes to the service</h2>
    <p>
      We may modify, pause or stop parts of the JobDash service at any time, with or without notice.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Changes to these Terms</h2>
    <p>
      We may update these Terms from time to time. When we do, we will update the date below.
      By continuing to use JobDash after changes, you accept the new Terms.

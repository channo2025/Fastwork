      <p class="sectionDesc">
        Win-Win Job is a digital job center and marketplace tool. We do not employ workers, we do not hire,
        and we are not an agent, broker, or party to any agreement between users.
        Any work arrangement, payment, and conditions are strictly between the Employer and Worker.
      </p>

      <h3>2) No guarantees</h3>
      <p class="sectionDesc">
        We do not guarantee that jobs will be filled, that workers will be hired, that payments will be made,
        or that users will behave properly. Use the service at your own risk.
      </p>

      <h3>3) Safety & responsibility</h3>
      <p class="sectionDesc">
        Users are responsible for their own safety and decisions. Always verify identity, pay, and location before
        starting work. Meet in safe places when possible. If you feel unsafe, do not proceed.
        For emergencies, contact local authorities.
      </p>

      <h3>4) Prohibited content & behavior</h3>
      <p class="sectionDesc">
        No illegal jobs, discrimination, harassment, exploitation, unsafe requests, or deceptive postings.
        We may remove content or suspend accounts at our discretion.
      </p>

      <h3>5) Payments</h3>
      <p class="sectionDesc">
        Payments are arranged directly between Employer and Worker. Win-Win Job is not responsible for payment disputes,
        chargebacks, or wage issues. We may offer reporting tools, but we are not obligated to mediate disputes.
      </p>

      <h3>6) Liability limitation</h3>

        your use of the service or any interaction between users.

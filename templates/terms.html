      <h3>1) Platform role</h3>
      <p>BaraConnect is a marketplace that helps users post and discover short-term gigs. We are not an employer, staffing agency, or payment processor unless explicitly stated.</p>

      <h3>2) User responsibility</h3>
      <p>Users are responsible for job details, communications, safety, taxes, and compliance with local laws. Always verify identity and job details before meeting.</p>

      <h3>3) Prohibited content</h3>
      <p>No scams, illegal work, discrimination, harassment, or requests for sensitive personal data (SSN, bank logins, etc.). We may remove content at any time.</p>

      <h3>4) Payments</h3>
      <p>Payments are arranged between users unless BaraConnect provides an in-app payment feature. BaraConnect is not liable for payment disputes in off-platform transactions.</p>

      <h3>5) Disclaimer</h3>
      <p>The service is provided “as is” without warranties. BaraConnect does not guarantee job quality, user behavior, or earnings.</p>

      <h3>6) Limitation of liability</h3>
      <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, BaraConnect is not liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from platform use.</p>

      <h3>7) Changes</h3>
      <p>We may update these Terms at any time. Continued use means you accept the updated Terms.</p>

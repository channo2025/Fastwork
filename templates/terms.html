<h1 class="page-title">Terms of Use</h1>
<p class="page-subtitle">
  Please read these simple terms before using JobDash.
</p>

<section class="section">
  <p style="font-size:0.95rem; color:#374151;">
    JobDash is a job posting platform. We connect people who need help with local
    workers, but we are not the employer. Clients and workers are responsible for
    their own agreements, payments and behavior.
  </p>
  <p style="font-size:0.95rem; color:#374151;">
    By using JobDash, you agree to:
  </p>
  <ul style="font-size:0.95rem; color:#374151; padding-left:18px;">
    <li>Post honest and accurate information about tasks.</li>
    <li>Respect workers and clients at all times.</li>
    <li>Handle payment directly and fairly.</li>
  </ul>
  <p style="font-size:0.95rem; color:#374151;">
    These terms may be updated as the platform grows.

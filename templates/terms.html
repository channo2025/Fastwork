    <p class="muted" style="margin-top:6px;">Last updated: 2026</p>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <h3 class="h3">1) Platform role (IMPORTANT)</h3>
    <p class="p">
      Win-Win Job is a digital job center / marketplace connector. We provide a platform for employers to post opportunities
      and for workers to discover and apply. We are not the employer, not the worker, and not an employment agency.
      We do not guarantee jobs, payments, outcomes, or the behavior of users.
    </p>

    <h3 class="h3" style="margin-top:14px;">2) No warranties</h3>
    <p class="p">
      The platform is provided “as is” and “as available.” We make no warranties regarding accuracy, reliability,
      availability, or suitability of any job listing, user, or content.
    </p>

    <h3 class="h3" style="margin-top:14px;">3) User responsibilities</h3>
    <ul style="margin-top:10px;padding-left:18px;">
      <li class="muted">Employers must post truthful information (pay, location, requirements).</li>
      <li class="muted">Workers must apply honestly and communicate respectfully.</li>
      <li class="muted">Users must comply with all local, state, and federal laws.</li>
      <li class="muted">Do not post illegal, discriminatory, misleading, or harmful content.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="h3" style="margin-top:14px;">4) Payments & disputes</h3>
    <p class="p">
      Payment is arranged directly between employer and worker. Win-Win Job does not process payments (unless explicitly stated in the future).
      Any dispute (non-payment, quality issues, cancellations, damages) is between users. We may assist by removing listings or accounts,
      but we are not liable for losses.
    </p>

    <h3 class="h3" style="margin-top:14px;">5) Safety disclaimer</h3>
    <p class="p">
      You are responsible for your safety. Meet in public places when possible. Confirm pay and location before work begins.
      Never share sensitive information (SSN, bank details). If you feel unsafe, do not proceed.
    </p>

    <h3 class="h3" style="margin-top:14px;">6) Limitation of liability</h3>
    <p class="p">
      To the maximum extent permitted by law, Win-Win Job and its owners/operators shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental,
      consequential, special, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits, data, or reputation, arising from use of the platform,
      job listings, or interactions between users.
    </p>

    <h3 class="h3" style="margin-top:14px;">7) Content & moderation</h3>
    <p class="p">
      We may remove content or suspend accounts at any time if we believe it violates these Terms, creates risk, or harms the community.
      We are not obligated to monitor all content.
    </p>

    <h3 class="h3" style="margin-top:14px;">8) Changes</h3>
    <p class="p">
      We may update these Terms. Continued use after changes means you accept the updated Terms.
    </p>

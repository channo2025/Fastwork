    <h1>About JobDash Online</h1>

    <p>
        JobDash Online is a simple job center on the internet where people can
        post small local tasks and find workers ready to earn quick cash.
        No resume, no interview – just clear tasks and direct payment between
        people.
    </p>

    <h2>Our mission</h2>
    <p>
        Our mission is to make it easier for:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>People who need help with everyday tasks</li>
        <li>Workers who want to earn extra money quickly and flexibly</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        We want to connect local communities, help newcomers, students and
        part-time workers find opportunities, and make small jobs easier to organize.
    </p>

    <h2>Who is JobDash for?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Busy parents who need help with cleaning or shopping</li>
        <li>Students or newcomers looking for fast side jobs</li>
        <li>People who need help moving, yard work, or small home tasks</li>
        <li>Anyone who wants to post a simple, short-term job</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How JobDash works</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>The Employer posts a local job on JobDash (for example: cleaning, moving, yard work).</li>
        <li>Workers can view available jobs and decide which tasks match their skills.</li>
        <li>Employer and Worker contact each other directly to confirm details.</li>
        <li>Payment is handled directly between them after the job is done (cash or preferred method).</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>What JobDash is not</h2>
    <p>
        JobDash Online is <strong>not</strong> an employer and does not hire workers.
        We do not manage contracts, payment methods, or job performance.
        All agreements are directly between the people using the platform.
    </p>

    <h2>Future plans</h2>
    <p>
        In the future, we plan to add:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>User accounts for Employers and Workers</li>
        <li>Notifications and better job matching</li>
        <li>More safety and verification tools</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        JobDash Online is still in its early version, but we are working step by step
        to make it a trusted place for quick local jobs.

<h1 class="page-title">About JobDash</h1>
<p class="page-subtitle">
  JobDash is an online jobcenter for quick, local tasks – created from real experience in the community.
</p>

<section class="section">
  <p style="font-size:0.95rem; color:#374151;">
    JobDash was created after seeing how many people wait for hours at worker centers
    hoping for a small job, while many families and small businesses need help but don't
    know where to find reliable workers.
  </p>
  <p style="font-size:0.95rem; color:#374151;">
    Our mission is simple: make it easier for people to find quick work and for clients
    to get help with everyday tasks – without resumes, interviews or complicated applications.
  </p>
  <p style="font-size:0.95rem; color:#374151;">
    JobDash is especially helpful for newcomers, immigrants, students and anyone who needs
    flexible, same-day work to support their life in the U.S.

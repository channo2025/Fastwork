            <h2>Why JobDash?</h2>
            <p>
                Many people need help with small tasks — cleaning, moving, yard work, shopping,
                packing, delivery, and more. At the same time, thousands of workers, students,
                newcomers, and busy families need flexible ways to earn money.
            </p>

            <p>
                JobDash brings both needs together in one place:

            <h1>About JobDash</h1>

            <p>
                JobDash was created to make local work simple, fast, and accessible. 
                Every day, people need help with small tasks — cleaning, moving, yard work, 
                deliveries, shopping, and more. At the same time, thousands of workers 
                are looking for flexible ways to earn money quickly.
            </p>

<h2>JobChap & Jobcenter</h2>

<p>
JobChap is a digital platform inspired by real-world job centers such as Vozw Workers.
While traditional job centers operate physically, JobChap brings the job center experience online,
making it accessible anytime and anywhere.

<p>
JobChap operates as an independent digital platform and does not act as an employer,
recruiter, or staffing agency.

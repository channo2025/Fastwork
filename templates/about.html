  <h2>What is JobDash Online?</h2>
  <p>
    JobDash Online is an online platform where people can post short,
    local tasks such as cleaning, moving help, yard work, shopping, and more.
    Workers can browse available tasks and choose the ones that fit their schedule.
  </p>

  <h2>Why we created JobDash Online</h2>
  <p>
    Many people in the community need help with small tasks, and at the same time
    many workers, newcomers, students and busy parents need flexible ways to earn
    extra money. JobDash Online brings these two needs together:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Fast jobs</li>
    <li>Cash pay or simple app payments</li>
    <li>No long CV, no formal interview</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Who can use JobDash Online?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Workers</strong> – Anyone who wants quick local jobs and flexible hours.</li>
    <li><strong>Employers</strong> – Individuals, families or small businesses who need help.</li>
    <li><strong>Newcomers</strong> – People new to the USA who need simple jobs to start earning.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How it works</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>The Employer posts a job: location, category, description, and pay.</li>
    <li>Workers browse tasks and contact the Employer.</li>
    <li>Once the job is complete, the Employer pays the Worker directly.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Our vision</h2>
  <p>
    Our goal is to become a trusted platform for quick day jobs across the USA,
    giving workers more opportunities to earn and helping families get everyday
    tasks done faster.

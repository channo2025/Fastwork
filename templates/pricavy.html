  Simple, transparent information about how JobDash handles basic data.

<section class="section">
  <p style="font-size:0.95rem; color:#374151;">
    JobDash is a simple beta platform. We currently store only the information you enter
    when you post a job (title, category, location, pay and description). This is used
    only to display tasks to workers on the site.
  </p>
  <p style="font-size:0.95rem; color:#374151;">
    We do not sell your data. We do not share your data with advertisers. In a future
    version, this page will be updated with more details as we add accounts, payments
    or messaging.
